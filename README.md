Welcome to the **Ola Data Analytics Project**! This end-to-end project demonstrates how data analytics tools and techniques can be used to analyze the ride-sharing industry, from data extraction to visualization.  

## üìñ Overview  

This project provides hands-on experience with **SQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, walking through the complete data workflow:  
1. Extracting and cleaning raw data using SQL.  
2. Analyzing and summarizing data in Excel.  
3. Visualizing insights with interactive Power BI dashboards.  

## üåü Key Features  

### **SQL**  
- Extracted and prepared data from CSV files for analysis.  
- Efficiently handled relational database queries to generate insights such as:  
  - Retrieve successful bookings.  
  - Analyze ride distances by vehicle type.  
  - List top 5 customers based on bookings.  
  - Retrieve rides based on payment methods (e.g., UPI).

### **Excel**  
- Performed data analysis using pivot tables, advanced formulas, and custom calculations.  
- Provided meaningful insights into ride trends, cancellations, and revenue segments.

### **Power BI**  
- Built an interactive dashboard highlighting:  
  - Ride volumes and trends over time.  
  - Revenue breakdown by payment methods.  
  - Top vehicle types and customer insights.  
  - Cancellations and their reasons.  
- **Sample Dashboard**:
